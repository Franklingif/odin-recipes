        <p>Smash burgers are the ultimate comfort food, combining crispy, caramelized edges with juicy, tender beef to create a burger that feels like a nostalgic diner experience at home. These quick and easy burgers come together in minutes but deliver big on flavor. Using just a few key ingredients, you’ll be transported to a cozy diner where the burgers are always cooked to perfection.</p>

        <p>Start with ground beef, preferably an 80/20 mix, to get the ideal balance of fat and flavor. Season it with a generous pinch of salt and pepper to bring out the rich beefy taste. The trick to a perfect smash burger is in the cooking technique. Simply form the beef into balls, then smash them onto a hot, greased pan or griddle. This allows the burgers to crisp up around the edges while staying juicy on the inside. The sear creates a beautiful, crispy crust, while the inside stays tender and flavorful.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 soft hamburger roll, buttered and toasted</li>
            <li>Condiments and toppings as desired, such as mayonnaise, mustard, shredded lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and pickles</li>
            <li>4 ounces (110g) freshly ground beef chuck, divided into two 2-ounce (55g) balls</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 slice good melting cheese, such as American, cheddar, or homemade melting cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to prep your burgers</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Prepare burger bun by laying toppings on bottom half of bun. Have it nearby and ready for when your burger is cooked.</li>
            <li>Preheat a large stainless steel sauté pan or skillet over high heat for 2 minutes. Place balls of beef in pan and smash down with a stiff metal spatula, using a second spatula to add pressure. Smashed patties should be slightly wider than burger bun.</li>
            <li>Season generously with salt and pepper and allow to cook until patties are well browned and tops are beginning to turn pale pink/gray in spots, about 45 seconds. Using a bench scraper or the back side of a stiff metal spatula, carefully scrape patties from pan, making sure to get all of the browned bits.</li>
            <li>Flip patties and immediately place a slice of cheese over 1 patty, then stack the second directly on top. Immediately remove from pan and transfer to waiting burger bun. Serve.</li>
        </ol>
